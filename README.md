# udacity-projects
My projects that I built while studying Udacity's Intro to Programming class.
Animal Trading Cards Project is a basic webpage built using vanilla HTML and CSS. It portrays a "trading card" of a cat, with a description, picture, and CSS styling to make it look somewhat like a baseball trading card.
