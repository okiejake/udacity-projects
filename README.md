These are my projects that I built while studying Udacity's Intro to Programming class.

The Animal Trading Cards Project is a basic webpage built using vanilla HTML and CSS. It portrays a "trading card" of a cat, with a description, picture, and CSS styling to make it look somewhat like a baseball trading card.

Rock Paper Scissors is exactly what it sounds like! It's a Python app that lets you play rock paper scissors. It includes different computer players that follow various strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.

Pixel Art Maker is a webpage built with JavaScript. It allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.
